This was the Help of samwhoo and ChatGPT. I have experience in coding.

TTS Messages from choosen Twitch Chatters to be read out loud in different AI Voices. 
TTS is saved as MP3 FIles in choosen directory.
Supposed to make charakters in OBS appear/dissapear, move up/down and have them move according to the AI's voice. 





TO Do list:


the code should turn off/on OBS pictures, move them (up/down)
it should change pictures that move depending on the voice

give them different voices (make it official)

make it change from "allowed users" to "everyone", and vice versa
